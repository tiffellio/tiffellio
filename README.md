- 👋 Hi, I’m Tiff! (@tiffellio)

- 👀 I’m currently interested in web development, front end design, and anything related to data. 

- 🌱 I’m currently reviewing PHP and MySQL as it's been a long time since I have used either... I'm used to using C++/SQL for data so I am working 
on a couple little projects with PHPMyAdmin and the classic 'LAMP' stack which I will be posting here shortly. You can see updates on my current project by visiting
statbench.ca which is a fitness and nutrition dashboard.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - nothing at this moment! Currenlty doing some personal projects but if anyone has any ideas feel free to reach me on discord.

- 📫 How to reach me - you can reach me on Discord (.tiff #4645) or instagram (@tiffellio).
